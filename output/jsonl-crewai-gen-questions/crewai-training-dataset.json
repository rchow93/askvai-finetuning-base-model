      {"role": "assistant", "content": "CrewAI is a lean, standalone Python framework for orchestrating autonomous AI agents designed for collaborative intelligence. Unlike other frameworks like LangChain, CrewAI is built entirely from scratch with no dependencies on other agent frameworks, making it faster and more resource-efficient.\n\nKey differences include:\n\n1. Flexibility: CrewAI offers both high-level simplicity through 'Crews' (autonomous agents) and precise control through 'Flows' (event-driven orchestration).\n\n2. Performance: Being standalone, it provides faster execution and lighter resource demands compared to other frameworks.\n\n3. Deep customization: You can tailor everything from high-level workflows to low-level internal prompts and agent behaviors.\n\n4. Integration: You can seamlessly combine Crews (optimized for autonomy) and Flows (optimized for precision) to create complex real-world automations.\n\n5. Community support: It's backed by robust documentation and a large community of certified developers."}

Each agent has a specific role, expertise, and responsibilities - similar to departments in a company. Crews optimize for autonomous operation and collaborative intelligence, allowing agents to make decisions based on their roles and available tools.\n\n```python\nfrom crewai import Crew, Process\n\ncrew = Crew(\n    agents=[researcher, analyst, writer],\n    tasks=[research_task, analysis_task, writing_task],\n    process=Process.sequential\n)\n```\n\n**Tasks**:\nTasks are specific requirements completed by agents. Each task needs:\n- A clear description of what needs to be done\n- The expected output format\n- Assignment to a specific agent\n- Optional context from other tasks\n- Optional tools for completion\n\n```python\nfrom crewai import Task\n\nresearch_task = Task(\n    description=\"Research the latest developments in AI\",\n    expected_output=\"A comprehensive report on recent AI breakthroughs\",\n    agent=researcher,\n    async_execution=False\n)\n\nwriting_task = Task(\n    description=\"Write an article about AI advancements\",\n    expected_output=\"A 4-paragraph article about AI\",\n    agent=writer,\n    context=[research_task]  # This task uses the output of research_task\n)\n```\n\nCrews can execute tasks sequentially or in parallel, with the output of one task potentially serving as context for subsequent tasks."}
