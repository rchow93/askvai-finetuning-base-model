{"instruction": "Could you guide me through utilizing Time Travel Debugging with AgentOps to analyze CrewAI session checkpoints?", "input": "", "output": "Time Travel Debugging is a feature provided by AgentOps that allows developers to restart sessions from specific checkpoints. This can be incredibly useful for analyzing and debugging CrewAI agent interactions in detail. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use Time Travel Debugging with AgentOps:\n\n### Prerequisites:\n1. You need to have an active AgentOps account and have created an API key.\n2. Make sure you've installed the AgentOps SDK in your project.\n3. Ensure that your CrewAI agent is configured to log checkpoints.\n\n### Step 1: Initialize AgentOps\nBefore using any AgentOps features, initialize it in your script with your API key:\n\n```python\nimport agentops\nagentops.init(API_KEY='<YOUR_AGENTOPS_API_KEY>')\n```\n\nReplace `<YOUR_AGENTOPS_API_KEY>` with your actual API key.\n\n### Step 2: Configure Your Agent to Log Checkpoints\nTo enable Time Travel Debugging, you need to configure your CrewAI agent to log checkpoints at regular intervals or significant points in the conversation. This can be done by setting up a checkpoint strategy when initializing your agent:\n\n```python\nfrom crew import Agent\n\nagent = Agent(\n    # ...other configurations...\n    checkpoint_strategy=\"interval\",  # You can also use \"milestone\" for specific points in the dialogue\n    checkpoint_interval=60,  # In seconds\n)\n```\n\nIn this example, checkpoints will be logged every 60 seconds.\n\n### Step 3: Run Your Agent and Generate Session Checkpoints\nRun your agent as you normally would. As it interacts with users or processes tasks, AgentOps will log these checkpoints.\n\n### Step 4: Accessing the Time Travel Debugging Dashboard\nLog in to your AgentOps dashboard. You should see a new section for \"Time Travel\" or something similar. Here, you can select a specific session and use the time slider to navigate through the conversation at checkpoint intervals.\n\n### Step 5: Restarting a Session from a Checkpoint\nTo restart a session from a specific checkpoint, click on that point in the time slider. AgentOps will then replay the conversation starting from this point. You can observe the exact state of the agent's internal variables and the user's inputs at each checkpoint.\n\n### Example Python Code to Log Checkpoints\nHere's an example of how you might configure your CrewAI agent to log checkpoints programmatically:\n\n```python\nfrom crew import Agent\nimport agentops\n\n# Initialize AgentOps\nagentops.init(API_KEY='<YOUR_AGENTOPS_API_KEY>')\n\n# Create a CrewAI agent and configure checkpoint strategy\nagent = Agent(\n    models=[...],  # Your model details here\n    checkpoint_strategy=\"interval\",\n    checkpoint_interval=60,  # In seconds\n    on_checkpoint=lambda state: agentops.log_checkpoint(state)  # Log the state at each checkpoint\n)\n```\n\nIn this example, `agentops.log_checkpoint(state)` is a hypothetical function that would send the current state of your agent to AgentOps for logging as a checkpoint. This needs to be implemented based on how your CrewAI agent and AgentOps SDK interact.\n\nRemember, for detailed implementation guidance, refer to the official [AgentOps documentation](https://agentops.com/docs/) or their Discord community for support."}

The logging in AgentOps mainly serves for high-level cost oversight and monitoring. \n\nRemember to replace \"Your Prompt Here\" with the actual prompt you're using, and \"my-model\" with your specific model name. Also, ensure that the AgentOps library is correctly installed and imported before running this script.\n\nFor more detailed information, including setting up custom events or configuring cost alerts, please refer to the official AgentOps documentation."}
{"instruction": "What are the steps for generating a dashboard in AgentOps to monitor high-level statistics of my CrewAI agents in development and production?", "input": "", "output": "To generate a dashboard in AgentOps for monitoring high-level statistics of your CrewAI agents, you would typically follow these steps:\n\n1. **Create an API Key:**\n   First, you need to create an API key from the AgentOps platform. This key will be used to authenticate your requests.\n\n   ```python\n   import requests\n\n   response = requests.post('https://api.agentops.com/v1/create_key', json={})  # Replace with actual endpoint and necessary parameters\n   api_key = response.json()['api_key']  # Assuming the response JSON contains 'api_key'\n   ```\n\n2. **Configure Your Environment:**\n   Add this API key to your environment variables for easy access in your scripts or applications.\n\n   On Unix/Linux/MacOS:\n   ```bash\n   export AGENTOPS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here\n   ```\n   On Windows (Command Prompt):\n   ```cmd\n   set AGENTOPS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here\n   ```\n\n3. **Install AgentOps:**\n   Install the AgentOps package in your project. You can typically do this via pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install agentops  # Replace with actual installation command if different\n   ```\n\n4. **Initialize AgentOps:**\n   In your Python script or application, initialize AgentOps using your API key.\n\n   ```python\n   import agentops\n\n   agentops.init(api_key='AGENTOPS_API_KEY')  # Replace 'AGENTOPS_API_KEY' with the actual environment variable name containing your API key\n   ```\n\n5. **Create and Configure Dashboard:**\n   With AgentOps initialized, you can create and configure a dashboard to monitor high-level statistics of your agents.\n\n   The exact method to create and configure the dashboard may vary depending on the AgentOps platform's API or SDK. Typically, you might use REST APIs or SDK methods to define what metrics you want to track (like cost, token usage, latency, etc.) and how they should be displayed in the dashboard.\n\n   Here is a hypothetical example using Python and assuming an AgentOps SDK:\n\n   ```python\n   from agentops import Dashboard, Metric\n\n   # Initialize a new dashboard\n   dashboard = Dashboard(name='My CrewAI Agents Dashboard')\n   \n   # Add metrics to track (replace with actual metrics available in AgentOps)\n   cost_metric = Metric('cost', type='currency')  # Example of tracking cost\n   token_usage_metric = Metric('prompt_tokens', 'completion_tokens', type='integer')  # Example of tracking tokens\n\n   dashboard.add_metrics([cost_metric, token_usage_metric])\n   \n   # Save and configure the dashboard (this would involve sending a request to the AgentOps API)\n   dashboard.save(config={\n       'production': True,  # Set to False if it's for development\n       'refresh_interval': 'PT1H'  # Refresh interval (e.g., every hour)\n   })\n   ```\n\nPlease note that this is a hypothetical example as the actual implementation might differ based on the AgentOps platform's specific API or SDK.
