Here are some of these features described in detail:\n\n**Time Travel Debugging:**\n\nThis feature allows you to restart your agent sessions from specific checkpoints, providing a way to navigate through the session history and identify issues. It helps developers trace back the execution flow and understand how the agent reached certain states or encountered errors. AgentOps provides a visual representation of these checkpoints, making it easier to pinpoint the exact moment when an issue occurred.\n\n**Prompt Injection Detection:**\n\nAgentOps offers prompt injection detection to help identify potential security risks. This feature scans for malicious or unintended code injections and secret leaks in the prompts provided to the agents. It ensures that the agent's behavior remains safe and secure, especially when interacting with external sources or user inputs.\n\nHere's an example of how you might initialize AgentOps and enable these debugging tools in Python:\n\n```python\nimport agentops\n\n# Initialize AgentOps\nagentops.init()\n\n# Example usage of Time Travel Debugging (replace with your own logic)\ndef debug_session(session_id):\n    # Implement your time travel debugging logic here\n    pass\n\n# Example usage of Prompt Injection Detection (replace with your prompt processing logic)\ndef process_prompt(prompt):\n    # Sanitize and validate the prompt to detect potential injections\n    sanitized_prompt = agentops.sanitize_input(prompt)\n    return sanitized_prompt\n```\n\nIn this example, you can customize the `debug_session` function to provide specific session data or context for time travel debugging. Similarly, the `process_prompt` function can be tailored to your prompt processing pipeline, utilizing AgentOps' input sanitization and validation features for prompt injection detection.\n\nThese tools within AgentOps empower developers to gain insights into agent behavior, handle errors gracefully, and maintain a secure environment for CrewAI agents during development and deployment."}
