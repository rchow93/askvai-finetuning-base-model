{"instruction": "How do I create a new agent in CrewAI using the YAML configuration method, and what should I include in the `agents.yaml` file to define the agent's role, goal, and behavior?", "input": "", "output": "To create a new agent in CrewAI using the YAML configuration method, you need to specify the agent's role, goal, behavior, and other relevant parameters in the `agents.yaml` file. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it:\n\n**1. Define the Agent Role**\n\nThe first section of the `agents.yaml` file defines the agent's role. This is where you specify the agent's purpose or function.\n\n```yaml\n- name: MyResearchAgent\n  role:\n    description: Expert researcher in Machine Learning and AI.\n    keywords:\n      - machine-learning\n      - ai\n```\n\nIn this example, we define an agent named `MyResearchAgent` with a description of its role and relevant keywords.\n\n**2. Specify the Agent's Goal**\n\nThe next section defines the agent's goal or objective.\n\n```yaml\n  goal:\n    type: String\n    description: Research papers on Machine Learning and AI.\n    values:\n      - \"Publish research paper\"\n      - \"Participate in Kaggle competitions\"\n```\n\nHere, we specify that our agent's goal is to publish a research paper related to Machine Learning and AI.\n\n**3. Define the Agent's Behavior**\n\nThis section outlines how the agent will behave or respond to different scenarios.\n\n```yaml\n  behavior:\n    type: String\n    description: Responds with suggestions for improving research papers.\n    values:\n      - \"Provide suggestions\"\n      - \"Recommend libraries\"\n```\n\nOur agent responds by providing suggestions for improving research papers related to Machine Learning and AI.\n\n**4. Configure the Language Model**\n\nThe next section specifies the language model to be used by the agent. In this case, we're using OpenAI's GPT-4.\n\n```yaml\n  llm:\n    type: String\n    description: OpenAI's GPT-4\n    values:\n      - \"gpt-4\"\n```\n\nHere, we specify that our agent will use OpenAI's GPT-4 language model.\n\n**5. Add Knowledge Sources**\n\nThis section allows you to add domain-specific knowledge bases or sources relevant to the agent's role and behavior.\n\n```yaml\n  knowledge_sources:\n    type: List[BaseKnowledgeSource]\n    description: Machine Learning and AI research papers.\n```\n\nIn this example, we specify that our agent has access to a list of machine learning and AI research papers as its knowledge sources.\n\n**6. Define Custom Configuration (Optional)**\n\nYou can also define custom configuration settings for your agent.\n\n```yaml\n  embedder:\n    type: Dict[str, Any]\n    description: Configuration for the embedder used by the agent.\n```\n\nHere, we specify a dictionary with custom configuration settings for the embedder used by our agent.\n\n**7. Finalize and Test**\n\nAfter defining all these sections, you can finalize your `agents.yaml` file and test your agent in CrewAI to ensure it's working as expected.\n\nBy following this guide, you can create new agents in CrewAI using YAML configuration files, specifying their role, goal, behavior, and other relevant parameters."}
{"instruction": "What is the purpose of the `llm` parameter in the CrewAI agent configuration, and how can I specify a custom language model if OpenAI's GPT4 is not suitable for my use case?", "input": "", "output": "The `llm` parameter in the CrewAI agent configuration refers to the language model used by the agent. In the provided YAML configuration, the default value is OpenAI's GPT4.\n\nTo specify a custom language model, you can use the `knowledge embedder` parameter, which allows you to configure a custom embedder for knowledge retrieval. The embedder is responsible for transforming text into numerical representations that can be processed by the agent.\n\nHere's an example of how to use a custom embedder in the YAML configuration:\n\n```yml\nknowledge_embedder:\n  type: CustomEmbedder\n  # Define your custom embedder configuration here\n  # For example, you might want to use a library like Hugging Face Transformers\n```\n\nIn this example, we're using the `CustomEmbedder` type to specify a custom embedder. The actual implementation of the embedder would depend on your specific requirements and the libraries you choose to use.\n\nTo create a custom embedder in code, you can extend the `KnowledgeEmbedder` class from the CrewAI library:\n\n```python\nimport crewai\n\nclass CustomEmbedder(krewai.KnowledgeEmbedder):\n    def __init__(self, model_name, device='cuda'):\n        # Initialize your custom embedder here\n        # For example, using a library like Hugging Face Transformers\n        self.model = transformers.AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name, device=device)\n```\n\nYou can then use the custom embedder in your agent configuration by specifying it as follows:\n\n```yml\nknowledge_embedder:\n  type: CustomEmbedder\n  model_name: \"your_model_name\"\n  device: 'cuda'\n```\n\nThis way, you can choose a language model that best suits your specific requirements and avoid relying on OpenAI's GPT4."}

Here's an example of how to define a new agent:\n\n```python\nfrom crewai import Agent\n\nclass CodeDeveloperAgent(Agent):\n    def __init__(self, name, role=\"Code Developer\", goal=\"Write and debug Python code\"):\n        super().__init__(name=name, role=role, goal=goal)\n        \n        # Optional: Knowledge embedder configuration\n        self.knowledge_embedder = {\n            \"model\": \"BERT\",\n            \"tokenization\": \"WordPiece\"\n        }\n        \n        # Optional: Custom knowledge sources\n        self.knowledge_sources = [\n            {\"source\": \"Stack Overflow\", \"domain\": \"Programming\"},\n            {\"source\": \"GitHub\", \"domain\": \"Open-Source Software\"}\n        ]\n```\n\nIn this example, we define a `CodeDeveloperAgent` class that inherits from the base `Agent` class. We set the role, goal, and other attributes as needed for our agent.\n\nWhen defining new agents with the direct code definition method, you should consider the following key parameters:\n\n1.  **role**: The role of the agent (e.g., Code Developer, Researcher).\n2.  **goal**: The primary objective or task that the agent is designed to accomplish.\n3.  **backstory**: A brief description of the agent's background and expertise.\n4.  **llm**: The language model used by the agent (default: OpenAI GPT-4).\n5.  **memory**: Enable to maintain conversation history (`respect_context_window`).\n6.  **knowledge\\_sources**: Add domain-specific knowledge bases.\n7.  **max\\_iter**: Maximum attempts before giving the best answer (`max_execution_time`).\n\nYou can adjust these parameters according to your specific requirements and the needs of your project.\n\nTo use this agent in a CrewAwAI pipeline, you would import it into your `Crew` class or process:\n\n```python\nfrom crewai import Agent\n\nclass MyPipeline:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.agent = CodeDeveloperAgent(\n            name=\"Code Developer\",\n            role=\"Code Developer\",\n            goal=\"Write and debug Python code\"\n        )\n```\n\nThis is a basic example of how to create a code development agent using the direct code definition method in CrewAwAI."}
{"instruction": "What is the significance of the `max_iter` parameter in CrewAI, and how can I adjust it to balance response time and accuracy for my specific use case?", "input": "", "output": "The `max_iter` parameter in CrewAI controls the maximum number of attempts that an agent will make before giving up on a task or returning its best answer. This parameter is crucial in balancing response time and accuracy for your specific use case.\n\n**Default Value:** The default value for `max_iter` is not explicitly stated in the provided documentation, but it's implied to be a reasonable value based on the underlying AI algorithms used by CrewAI.\n\n**Adjusting max_iter:**\n\nTo adjust the `max_iter` parameter, you can modify the `Agent` class configuration as shown in the example code snippet:\n```python\nknowledge_sources=None\n\n# Optional:\n\nknowledge_embedder=None\n\n# Optional:\n\ncustom_embedder_configuration = {\n    # Configuration for custom embedder\n}\n```\nIn this case, we're not explicitly setting a value for `max_iter`, but you can adjust it by modifying the `Agent` class configuration. For example, to set a higher maximum number of attempts:\n```python\nknowledge_sources=None\n\n# Optional:\n\nknowledge_embedder=None\n\nmax_iter=10  # Set max_iter to 10\n\n# Optional:\n\ncustom_embedder_configuration = {\n    # Configuration for custom embedder\n}\n```\n**Balancing Response Time and Accuracy:**\n\nWhen adjusting the `max_iter` parameter, keep in mind that increasing this value can improve accuracy but may also increase response time. Conversely, decreasing the value can reduce response time but may compromise accuracy.\n\nTo strike a balance between response time and accuracy, consider the following strategies:\n\n1. **Monitor performance metrics:** Keep track of your agent's performance using metrics such as accuracy, response time, and user satisfaction. Analyze these metrics to determine the optimal `max_iter` value for your specific use case.\n2. **Use incremental learning:** Implement incremental learning techniques, which allow your agent to learn from its mistakes and improve over time. This can help increase accuracy without compromising response time.\n3. **Implement timeout mechanisms:** Consider implementing timeout mechanisms that terminate the conversation after a certain number of attempts or a specified time limit.\n\nBy carefully adjusting the `max_iter` parameter and considering these strategies, you can balance response time and accuracy for your specific use case and create an effective CrewAI agent."}
{"instruction": "How do I integrate custom knowledge sources into my CrewAI agents using the `knowledge_sources` parameter, and what types of domain-specific knowledge bases can I use to enhance the agent's performance?", "input": "", "output": "**Integrating Custom Knowledge Sources**\n\nTo integrate custom knowledge sources into your CrewAI agents, you can utilize the `knowledge_sources` parameter. This parameter allows you to specify a list of `BaseKnowledgeSource` objects that will be used by the agent to gather and process knowledge.\n\nHere's an example of how to define custom knowledge sources:\n\n```python\n# Create a custom embedder for our knowledge source\nembedder = {\n    \"name\": \"CustomEmbedder\",\n    \"type\": \"FileEmbedder\",\n    \"path\": \"/path/to/knowledge/base\"\n}\n\n# Define the knowledge sources using the embedder\nknowledge_sources = [\n    BaseKnowledgeSource(\n        role=\"General Knowledge\",\n        embedder=embedder,\n    ),\n    BaseKnowledgeSource(\n        role=\"Domain-Specific Knowledge\",\n        embedder=embedder,\n        domain=\"mydomain.com\",\n    ),\n]\n\n# Create an agent with custom knowledge sources\nagent = Agent(\n    role=\"Researcher\",\n    goal=\"Answer questions about my area of expertise\",\n    backstory=\"Expert in research and analysis\",\n    allow_code_execution=True,\n    code_execution_mode=\"safe\",\n    max_execution_time=300,  # 5-minute timeout\n    max_retry_limit=3,  # More retries for complex code tasks\n    knowledge_sources=knowledge_sources,\n)\n```\n\nIn this example, we define a custom embedder using the `FileEmbedder` class and specify its path. We then create two knowledge sources: one for general knowledge and another for domain-specific knowledge. The `domain` parameter is used to filter the knowledge source to only include relevant information.\n\n**Domain-Specific Knowledge Sources**\n\nTo use domain-specific knowledge bases, you can modify the `knowledge_sources` parameter to include additional parameters such as `domain`, `language`, or `schema`. Here's an updated example:\n\n```python\n# Define a custom knowledge source for domain-specific knowledge\ncustom_knowledge_source = BaseKnowledgeSource(\n    role=\"Domain-Specific Knowledge\",\n    embedder=embedder,\n    domain=\"mydomain.com\",\n)\n\n# Create another custom knowledge source with language and schema parameters\nlanguage_knowledge_source = BaseKnowledgeSource(\n    role=\"Language-Specific Knowledge\",\n    embedder=embedder,\n    domain=\"lang1.com\",\n    language=\"en\",\n    schema={\"type\": \"JSON\", \"fields\": [\"field1\", \"field2\"]},\n)\n\n# Create an agent with custom knowledge sources\nagent = Agent(\n    role=\"Researcher\",\n    goal=\"Answer questions about my area of expertise\",\n    backstory=\"Expert in research and analysis\",\n    allow_code_execution=True,\n    code_execution_mode=\"safe\",\n    max_execution_time=300,  # 5-minute timeout\n    max_retry_limit=3,  # More retries for complex code tasks\n    knowledge_sources=[\n        custom_knowledge_source,\n        language_knowledge_source,\n    ],\n)\n```\n\nIn this updated example, we define a second custom knowledge source with additional parameters such as `domain`, `language`, and `schema`. The `schema` parameter is used to specify the format of the data in the knowledge base.\n\n**Best Practices**\n\nWhen integrating custom knowledge sources into your CrewAI agents:\n\n* Use clear and concise role descriptions to ensure that the agent understands its responsibilities.\n* Define a consistent naming convention for your custom embedders and knowledge sources.\n* Test your custom knowledge sources thoroughly to ensure they are correctly integrated with the agent.\n* Consider using Docker or other containerization techniques to ensure reproducibility of your custom embedders.\n\nBy following these guidelines and examples, you can effectively integrate custom knowledge sources into your CrewAI agents, enhancing their performance and effectiveness."}
