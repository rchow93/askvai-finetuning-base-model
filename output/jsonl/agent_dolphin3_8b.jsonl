{"instruction": "How do I create a user API key for AgentOps?", "input": "", "output": "To create a user API key for AgentOps, follow these steps:\n\n1. Go to the AgentOps website or navigate to their page through your web browser.\n2. Look for a section that says \"Create an API Key\" or something similar.\n3. Click on the link or button provided to proceed.\n4. Fill in the necessary information required to create the API key, such as your name and email address (or any other relevant details).\n5. Once you have submitted the required information, AgentOps will generate a unique user API key for you.\n\nHere is an example of how you can add the API key to your environment variables:\n\n```\nimport os\n\n# Replace <YOUR_AGENTOPS_API_KEY> with your actual API key\nos.environ['AGENTOPS_API_KEY'] = '<YOUR_AGENTOPS_API_KEY>'\n```\n\nThis code sets the environment variable `AGENTOPS_API_KEY` to the value of your user API key. You can then use this variable in your script or application when interacting with AgentOps.\n\nMake sure to keep your API key secure and do not share it publicly, as anyone who has access to it can potentially misuse it."}
{"instruction": "How do I add my API key to my environment variables?", "input": "", "output": "To add your API key to your environment variables, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine which operating system you are using (Windows, macOS, or Linux) and use the appropriate method below.\n\n2. **For Windows:**\n   - Right-click on \"This PC\" or \"Computer\" on your desktop or in File Explorer.\n   - Select \"Properties.\"\n   - Click on \"Advanced system settings\" on the left side.\n   - Click on \"Environment Variables.\"\n   - In the \"System variables\" section, find the variable named `HTTP_PROXY` (or similar) and click edit. If it doesn't exist, create a new variable with the name `HTTP_PROXY`.\n   - Set the value to your API key prefixed with `http://`.\n   - Click OK to close all windows.\n\n3. **For macOS:**\n   - Open Terminal.\n   - Add your API key to your `.bash_profile` or `.zshrc` file (the exact file may vary depending on your shell). You can do this by running the following command and replacing `<YOUR_API_KEY>` with your actual API key:\n\n```\necho 'export API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>' >> ~/.bash_profile\n```\n\n   - After adding that line, run `source ~/.bash_profile` or `source ~/.zshrc` to load the new environment variables.\n\n4. **For Linux:**\n   - Open a terminal.\n   - Add your API key to your `.bashrc` file by running the following command and replacing `<YOUR_API_KEY>` with your actual API key:\n\n```\necho 'export API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>' >> ~/.bashrc\n```\n\n   - After adding that line, run `source ~/.bashrc` to load the new environment variables.\n\n5. **Verify Your Environment Variable:**\n   - Open a new terminal (it doesn't matter if you're on Windows, macOS, or Linux) and enter the following command:\n\n```\necho $API_KEY\n```\n\n   - If your API key has been set correctly, it will print out in the terminal.\n\n6. **Integrate Your API Key into Your Application:**\n   - To use your environment variable within a Python script for example, you can access the `API_KEY` like so:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\napi_key = os.getenv('API_KEY')\n```\n\n7. **For Using Python in Jupyter Notebooks or JupyterLab:**\n   - For setting environment variables directly in a notebook or JupyterLab, use the following code at the start of your notebook:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\nos.environ['API_KEY'] = '<YOUR_API_KEY>'\n```\n\nRemember to replace `<YOUR_API_KEY>` with your actual API key for all steps. This way, your API key will be securely stored and easily accessible in your environment variables."}
{"instruction": "What is the code block needed to install AgentOps?", "input": "", "output": "The code block needed to install AgentOps can be found in the \"How to Guides Agent Monitoring with AgentOps\" document under the \"Install AgentOps 3\" section.

Create an API Key\n   - Go to the link provided in the document: \"Create API Key\"\n   - Follow the instructions to create your API key.\n\n2. Install AgentOps\n   - Use either of the two methods mentioned in the document:\n     a. Using `pip`: \n        ```bash\n        pip install agentops --api-key <YOUR_AGENTOPS_API_KEY>\n        ```\n     b. Download and extract the binary:\n\n3. Initialize AgentOps\n   - In your script, include these lines before using Crew:\n   ```python\n   import agentops\n   agentops.init()\n   ```\n\nRemember to replace `<YOUR_AGENTOPS_API_KEY>` with the actual API key you obtained from step 1.\n\nFor further assistance or additional information, check out the AgentOps documentation or join their Discord community."}
{"instruction": "Before using Crew in my script, what lines should I include to initialize AgentOps?", "input": "", "output": "To initialize AgentOps before using it in your script, you need to import the agentops module and then use the init() function. The relevant lines of code are as follows:\n\n```python\nimport agentops\n\nagentops.init()\n```\n\nThis will set up the necessary components for AgentOps to start monitoring your Crew agents."}
{"instruction": "Can you provide an example of how to use AgentOps in a complex agentic system?", "input": "", "output": "Certainly! AgentOps can be used in complex agentic systems to monitor agent performance, track cost, latency, token usage, and identify potential issues such as infinite loops or security threats. Here is an example of how you might use AgentOps in a more complex system:\n\nLet's say we have a conversational AI agent that interacts with users on a chatbot platform. We want to monitor the agent's performance, track its interactions, and detect any potential issues.\n\n1. Create an API key for AgentOps by following the instructions provided in the documentation: https://<your_agentops_api_key>\n\n2. Install AgentOps in your environment:\n\n```python\npip install agentops\n```\n\n3. Initialize AgentOps before using it in your script:\n\n```python\nimport agentops\n\n# Initialize AgentOps with your API key\nagentops.init(api_key='<YOUR_AGENTOPS_API_KEY>')\n```\n\n4. Create a Crew agent that interacts with users on the chatbot platform:\n\n```python\nclass ChatBotAgent:\n    def __init__(self):\n        # Initialize the agent and connect to the chatbot platform\n\n    def process_user_input(self, user_input):\n        # Process the user input and generate a response\n        response = self.generate_response(user_input)\n        return response\n\n    def generate_response(self, user_input):\n        # Your code for generating responses based on user inputs\n        pass\n```\n\n5. Use AgentOps to monitor the agent's performance:\n\n```python\nagent = ChatBotAgent()\n\n# Wrap the agent with AgentOps monitoring\nwith agentops.Monitoring(agent) as monitored_agent:\n    response = monitored_agent.process_user_input(user_input)\n    # Monitor the agent's performance, track interactions, and detect issues\n\n    # Example of accessing metrics from AgentOps\n    print(\"LLM calls:\", monitored_agent.metrics.llm_calls)\n    print(\"Token usage:\", monitored_agent.metrics.token_usage)\n```\n\nIn this example, we create a `ChatBotAgent` class that represents our conversational AI agent. We then wrap the agent with `agentops.Monitoring`, which provides monitoring capabilities for the agent's performance and interactions.\n\nThe `metrics` property of the `monitored_agent` object gives us access to various metrics such as LLM calls, token usage, and more. We can use these metrics to monitor the agent's performance in real-time and take appropriate actions if any issues are detected.\n\nThis is just a simple example of how you might integrate AgentOps into a complex agentic system. Depending on your specific requirements, you may need to customize the monitoring setup further or explore other features provided by AgentOps."}
