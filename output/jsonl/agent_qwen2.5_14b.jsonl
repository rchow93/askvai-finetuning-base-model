{"instruction": "How does AgentOps enable session replays and what insights can be gained from them?", "input": "", "output": "AgentOps enables session replays through its comprehensive observability features designed to help developers understand how their conversational AI agents interact with users. Session replays are crucial for debugging purposes, understanding user interactions, identifying performance issues, and improving agent behaviors. Here's a detailed breakdown of how AgentOps handles session replays:\n\n### How AgentOps Enables Session Replays\n\n1. **Session Tracking**: When an agent is initialized in your code using the `agentops` library, it starts tracking all activities performed by the agent. This includes user interactions, API calls made by the agent, and any other operations that affect its behavior.\n\n2. **Recording Interactions**: Every interaction with a conversational AI agent (such as sending messages to an LLM or querying external APIs) is logged along with relevant metadata like timestamps, token usage, latency, and error details.\n\n3. **Data Aggregation**: Recorded data is aggregated into sessions based on user interactions or logical flow within your application. This ensures that all related activities are presented together for easy review.\n\n4. **Visualization in Dashboard**: The recorded session information can be visualized in the AgentOps dashboard. Here, developers and operators can watch step-by-step execution graphs, which provide a detailed view of how an agent handled a user's request from start to finish.\n\n### Insights Gained from Session Replays\n\n- **Behavior Analysis**: You can observe how an agent handles different types of input or queries, helping you understand its logic flow and decision-making process.\n  \n- **Performance Monitoring**: By analyzing latency data and API call details in session replays, you can identify performance bottlenecks or inefficiencies.\n\n- **Error Identification**: If an agent encounters issues like infinite loops (detected by Recursive Thought Detection) or fails to respond correctly, session replays allow pinpointing the exact cause of these errors through step-by-step analysis.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nTo demonstrate how session replays work in practice, consider a simple example where you initialize AgentOps and create a Crew AI agent that interacts with an LLM:\n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom crew import CrewAgent  # Assuming CrewAgent is your conversational AI class\nimport agentops\n\n# Initialize AgentOps with API key from environment variables\nos.environ['AGENTOPS_API_KEY'] = '<YOUR_AGENTOPS_API_KEY>'\nagentops.init()\n\n# Create and run an example agent\ndef main():\n    agent = CrewAgent()\n    \n    # Start monitoring session for the agent\n    agentops.start_session(agent.id)\n\n    try:\n        while True:  # Simulate a chat loop\n            user_message = input(\"User message: \")\n            if not user_message or user_message.lower() == 'exit':\n                break\n                \n            response = agent.generate_response(user_message)\n            print(f\"Agent Response: {response}\")\n            \n            # Example of recording API calls made by the agent\n            if \"search_website\" in dir(agent):\n                search_results = agent.search_website(query=\"example query\", website=\"example.com\")\n                agentops.log_search(search_results=search_results)\n\n    finally:\n        agentops.stop_session()\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\nIn this example, `agentops.start_session()` and `agentops.stop_session()` mark the start and end of a session. Within the session, any calls to API services are logged, and custom logging functions (like `log_search()`) can be used to record specific actions or data points.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAgentOps provides robust tools for monitoring and analyzing conversational AI agents through detailed session replays. By leveraging these features, developers gain valuable insights into agent performance, user interactions, and system reliability, enabling them to continuously improve their applications."}

This function simulates sending prompt-response interactions to an imaginary compliance check API of AgentOps, which would then return a report about any detected issues.\n\n- **Main Execution Block**: In the main block, we simulate a user-agent interaction and call our compliance check function with sample inputs.\n\n### Note:\nThe `agentops.check_compliance` is a hypothetical method for demonstration purposes. Actual usage would require accessing AgentOps' API documentation to understand the specific methods available for compliance checks and their parameters.\n\nThis code provides a starting point for integrating security and compliance features into your conversational AI agents using AgentOps, ensuring that all interactions adhere to necessary regulatory standards and protect user data privacy."}
{"instruction": "How can Recursive Thought Detection help prevent infinite loops during agent execution?", "input": "", "output": "Recursive Thought Detection is a feature provided by AgentOps that helps identify when agents fall into infinite loops. This detection mechanism monitors the recursive patterns or repetitive sequences in an agent's thought processes, which are indicative of potential infinite loop scenarios.\n\nWhen an AI agent starts repeating its thought cycles without making progress towards resolving the user query or task at hand, Recursive Thought Detection can flag this behavior to prevent wasted computational resources and ensure that agents respond efficiently and effectively. This is particularly useful for conversational AI where conversations can quickly become unproductive if the agent does not break out of repetitive questioning or decision-making patterns.\n\nHere's how you might set up an example in Python using a mock implementation to simulate Recursive Thought Detection:\n\nFirst, let's assume we have a simplified model of how thoughts or reasoning steps might be recorded for an AI agent. For this demonstration, each step can be thought of as a dictionary containing the thought and its timestamp.\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\nclass AgentThought:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.history = []\n\n    def think(self, message):\n        current_time = datetime.now()\n        entry = {\"message\": message, \"timestamp\": current_time}\n        self.history.append(entry)\n        \n        # Check for recursive thoughts here by comparing the recent steps\n        if len(self.history) > 1:\n            last_two_thoughts_same = (self.history[-2][\"message\"] == self.history[-1][\"message\"])\n            \n            # If the same message is repeated twice consecutively, raise an alert\n            if last_two_thoughts_same:\n                print(f\"Warning: Potential infinite loop detected! Last two thoughts are identical.\")\n                \n        return entry[\"timestamp\"]\n\n# Example Usage\nagent = AgentThought()\nagent.think(\"Analyzing request...\")\nagent.think(\"Still analyzing...\")  # This would trigger a warning about potential infinite loop\n\n# Let's try again, but this time let's assume the agent has fallen into an actual loop.\nfor _ in range(5):\n    agent.think(\"Infinite loop!\")  # Would continuously print out warnings\n```\n\nIn practice, AgentOps would handle the Recursive Thought Detection behind-the-scenes, monitoring your agents' execution and alerting you through its analytics dashboard if any potential infinite loops are detected. You wouldn't manually implement this feature yourself but rather configure AgentOps to monitor your specific agent(s) for such patterns.\n\nThis kind of detection is essential in preventing resource waste due to inefficient use of computational power and ensuring that users receive timely and relevant responses from AI agents, thereby enhancing the overall performance and user experience of conversational AI systems."}

This could be accuracy of information retrieval, adherence to certain rules or regulations, or the quality of output generated by the agent.\n\n2. **Write Test Cases:**\n\n   Write specific test cases that represent real-world situations where your agents would interact with users. For example:\n   \n   - If you're testing a legal compliance bot, write test cases related to common legal inquiries.\n   - If it's a technical support agent, create scenarios based on typical user issues.\n\n3. **Script Test Cases:**\n\n   Create scripts that simulate these interactions and include the expected responses or outcomes from your agents. Here\u2019s an example Python script for a hypothetical scenario:\n\n```python\nimport unittest\nfrom crew import Agent  # Assuming 'Agent' is a class provided by CrewAI\n\nclass CustomTests(unittest.TestCase):\n    \n    def setUp(self) -> None:\n        self.agent = Agent(api_key=\"your_api_key_here\")\n        self.agent.init_agentops()\n\n    def test_legal_compliance(self):\n        user_message = \"Is it legal to sell products without an EORI number in the EU?\"\n        expected_response = \"Selling products in the EU without a valid Economic Operators Registration and Identification (EORI) number is not compliant with EU regulations.\"\n        \n        response = self.agent.query(user_message)\n        \n        # Check if the agent's response contains the critical information\n        self.assertIn(\"EORI number\", response)\n        self.assertIn(\"EU regulations\", response)\n\n    def test_technical_support(self):\n        user_message = \"How do I install Python on my Mac?\"\n        expected_response = (\"To install Python on your Mac, you can use Homebrew. First, open Terminal and type 'brew install python'. This will install the latest stable version of Python.\")\n        \n        response = self.agent.query(user_message)\n        \n        # Check if the agent's response contains the critical information\n        self.assertIn(\"Homebrew\", response)\n        self.assertIn(\"python\", response)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    unittest.main()\n```\n\n4. **Integrate with AgentOps:**\n\n   To integrate these custom tests into AgentOps, you\u2019ll need to configure your environment to report back the results of these tests using the AgentOps API.\n\n5. **Run and Monitor Tests:**\n\n   Execute your test scripts regularly (e.g., daily, weekly) depending on the frequency required by your use case. Use the analytics dashboard in AgentOps to monitor the success rate and performance trends over time.\n\n6. **Adjust and Improve:**\n\n   Based on the results from the tests, refine your agents\u2019 training data or update their configurations to improve accuracy and performance in domain-specific scenarios.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSetting up custom tests with AgentOps provides a powerful way to ensure that your conversational AI agents are performing effectively within specific domains or industries. By scripting real-world scenarios and integrating test reporting into AgentOps, you can continuously evaluate and enhance the functionality of your agents based on actual needs and expectations.\n\nFor more detailed configuration options and advanced features, refer to the official documentation provided by AgentOps."}

{"instruction": "Is there a way to configure alerts or notifications based on specific agent performance metrics through AgentOps?", "input": "", "output": "Based on the provided document about CrewAI's AgentOps, it does not explicitly mention features for configuring alerts or notifications based on specific agent performance metrics. However, given that AgentOps provides comprehensive monitoring capabilities such as session replays, metrics tracking (including cost management, token usage, latency), and failure detection, it is highly likely that the platform supports advanced observability features which would include alerting.\n\nTo configure alerts in a similar system, you typically:\n\n1. **Set up an API key** to authenticate your requests.\n2. **Install and initialize AgentOps** within your Python scripts or environment.\n3. **Access the monitoring dashboard** where you can set up rules for specific metrics.\n4. **Configure alerting mechanisms** via APIs if provided by the platform.\n\nHere's a conceptual example of how one might configure alerts in a similar system using Python:\n\n### Step 1: Set Up API Key\n\nEnsure your environment variable is correctly configured with your AgentOps API key:\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ['AGENTOPS_API_KEY'] = 'your-agentops-api-key'\n```\n\n### Step 2: Initialize AgentOps\nYou would initialize the AgentOps library in your Python script.\n```python\nimport agentops\n\nagentops.init()\n```\n\n### Step 3: Set Up Alert Rules (Conceptual Example)\n\nIf AgentOps provides an API for setting up alert rules, you might have to call their RESTful API. Here's a conceptual example using `requests`:\n```python\nimport requests\n\n# Define your alert rule configuration\nalert_rule = {\n    \"metric\": \"latency\",\n    \"threshold\": 100,\n    \"operation\": \">\",\n    \"email_notification\": [\"user@example.com\"],\n    \"description\": \"Alert when latency exceeds 100ms.\"\n}\n\nheaders = {\n    'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n    'Authorization': f'Bearer {os.getenv(\"AGENTOPS_API_KEY\")}'\n}\n\nresponse = requests.post('https://api.agentops.ai/alerts', json=alert_rule, headers=headers)\n\nif response.status_code == 201:\n    print(f\"Alert rule created successfully: {response.json()}\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"Failed to create alert rule: {response.text}\")\n```\n\n### Note\nThis example is based on the typical pattern of how observability platforms might be configured for alerts and notifications. The actual API endpoint and details would depend on AgentOps's documentation, which may provide specific instructions or APIs for setting up alert rules.\n\nIf you need to configure alerts using AgentOps, it's best to refer directly to their official documentation or reach out to the support team as they will have detailed information about how to set up alerting mechanisms within their platform."}
{"instruction": "Can you give an example of using CrewAI in conjunction with AgentOps for cost management during development?", "input": "", "output": "Certainly! To use CrewAI in conjunction with AgentOps for cost management during development, we need to follow a series of steps that include setting up AgentOps, integrating it into our CrewAI scripts, and tracking costs related to large language models (LLMs).\n\n### Step 1: Setup AgentOps\n\nFirstly, you'll need to set up your environment by creating an API key from the AgentOps dashboard. Then, install the `agentops` library in your Python project.\n\n```bash\npip install agentops\n```\n\nNext, configure your environment with the AgentOps API key:\n\n```bash\nexport AGENTOPS_API_KEY=<YOUR_AGENTOPS_API_KEY>\n```\n\n### Step 2: Initialize AgentOps\n\nInclude these lines at the beginning of your CrewAI script to initialize `agentops` and track your agents automatically.\n\n```python\nimport agentops\n\n# Initialize AgentOps with your API key\nagentops.init()\n```\n\nThis will start logging agent interactions, session data, and cost information in real-time.\n\n### Step 3: Implement Cost Management Tracking\n\nTo specifically manage costs during development, you can use the `agentops` library to track LLM usage and correlate it with your CrewAI scripts. Here's an example of how to do this:\n\n```python\nimport agentops\nfrom crewai import Agent\n\n# Initialize AgentOps\nagentops.init()\n\ndef run_agent():\n    # Create a new instance of CrewAI Agent\n    agent = Agent()\n    \n    # Example interaction that would trigger LLM calls\n    response = agent.respond(\"What is the weather in San Francisco?\")\n    \n    return response\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    import time\n    \n    start_time = time.time()\n    response = run_agent()\n    \n    # Log a custom metric to track cost and usage\n    agentops.log('crewai_response', {\n        'duration': time.time() - start_time,\n        'tokens_used': 10,  # Example token count\n        'cost_usd': 0.05,   # Example cost in USD\n    })\n    \n    print(response)\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- We define a function `run_agent` which initializes a CrewAI agent and interacts with it.\n- After the interaction, we use `agentops.log()` to record custom metrics such as duration of execution (`duration`), tokens used during LLM calls (`tokens_used`), and estimated cost in USD (`cost_usd`). This is useful for tracking costs over time.\n\n### Step 4: Monitor Costs via AgentOps Dashboard\n\nOnce you have the logging setup, you can navigate to the AgentOps dashboard to monitor these metrics. The dashboard will show session-wide statistics which include:\n- Total token usage\n- Estimated cost\n- Response latency times\n\nYou can use this information to optimize your CrewAI scripts for better efficiency and lower costs during development.\n\n### Additional Configuration\n\nFor more advanced configurations, you might want to customize the way LLM calls are tracked. For example, if you have a custom function that interacts with an external API like OpenAI's GPT-3:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom agentops import log_metric\n\ndef get_response_from_api(prompt):\n    response = requests.post(\n        \"https://api.openai.com/v1/engines/davinci-codex/completions\",\n        headers={\"Authorization\": f\"Bearer {YOUR_API_KEY}\"},\n        json={\"prompt\": prompt, \"max_tokens\": 50}\n    )\n    \n    # Track the API call cost and token usage\n    log_metric('llm_api_call', {\n        'tokens_used': response.json().get('usage', {}).get('total_tokens'),\n        'cost_usd': (response.json().get('usage', {}).get('total_tokens') / 1000) * 0.02, # Example cost calculation\n    })\n    \n    return response.json()['choices'][0]['text']\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    prompt = \"What is the weather in San Francisco?\"\n    print(get_response_from_api(prompt))\n```\n\nIn this example, we use `log_metric` to report metrics directly from API calls. You can adjust the cost calculations based on your LLM provider's pricing model.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy integrating AgentOps with CrewAI during development, you gain powerful observability features that help manage costs efficiently and ensure smooth operation of your conversational AI agents. This setup allows for real-time monitoring and detailed analysis through the AgentOps dashboard, providing actionable insights to optimize performance and resource usage."}

This can be done using the following steps:\n   \n   - Export the API key as an environment variable:\n     ```sh\n     export AGENTOPS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here\n     ```\n     \n   - Or set it directly in your Python script (although this is less secure for production environments):\n     ```python\n     import os\n     os.environ['AGENTOPS_API_KEY'] = 'your_api_key_here'\n     ```\n\n5. **Install AgentOps:**\n   Use pip to install the AgentOps library if not already installed.\n   \n   - Install via `pip`:\n     ```sh\n     pip install agentops\n     ```\n     \n6. **Initialize AgentOps in Your Script:**\n   Before you start using Crew agents, ensure that your script initializes AgentOps correctly.\n\n   Here is an example of how to initialize AgentOps and use it with CrewAI:\n\n   ```python\n   import os\n   import agentops\n\n   # Initialize AgentOps with your API key from environment variable\n   agentops.init(os.environ.get('AGENTOPS_API_KEY'))\n\n   # Example usage: Initializing a Crew agent (pseudo-code as the actual initialization depends on how you're integrating with CrewAI)\n   if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n       import crew  # This is pseudo code and may need adjustment based on your setup.\n       \n       # Initialize your Crew agent\n       my_agent = crew.Agent()\n      \n       # Start monitoring your Agent with AgentOps\n       agentops.start_monitoring(my_agent)\n\n       # Your logic for running the agent goes here...\n\n   ```\n\n7. **Verify Setup:**\n   After setting up, test to ensure that all configurations are correct and data is being recorded as expected in the AgentOps dashboard.\n\n8. **Explore Features:**\n   Use the provided documentation or visit the AgentOps dashboard to explore various features such as monitoring session replays, checking metrics, etc.\n\nFor more detailed instructions on specific features like LLM Cost Management, Prompt Tokens, Completion Tokens, and others, refer to the official [AgentOps Repo](AGENTOPS_REPO_URL) for comprehensive guides and examples."}
