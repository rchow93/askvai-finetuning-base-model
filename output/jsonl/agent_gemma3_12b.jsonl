Create an AgentOps Account:**\n\n   *   The first step is to create an AgentOps account. This is necessary to access the features and dashboard.\n\n**2. Create an API Key:**\n\n   *   Create a user API key within your AgentOps account. You can find this option here: [Create API Key](Create API Key)\n\n**3. Configure Your Environment:**\n\n   *   Add your AgentOps API key to your environment variables. The document provides the following example:\n\n     ```\n     AGENTOPS_API_KEY=<YOUR_AGENTOPS_API_KEY>\n     ```\n\n**4. Install AgentOps:**\n\n   *   Install AgentOps using the provided code block (the specific code block isn's provided in the document).\n\n**5.

It simply states that AgentOps provides LLM Cost Management and Tracking as a feature. You're expected to explore the AgentOps dashboard and documentation for details on how to view and analyze this cost data.\n*   Refer to the AgentOps documentation or join the Discord for more detailed information on how to outfit more complex agentic systems and utilize the cost tracking features."}
{"instruction": "**How can I monitor the number of prompt and completion tokens used by my agents?** (AgentOps tracks Prompt Tokens and Completion Tokens.)", "input": "", "output": "According to the provided document, AgentOps allows you to track the number of prompt and completion tokens used by your agents. Specifically, it mentions \"LLM Cost Management and Tracking\" which includes tracking \"Prompt Tokens\" and \"Completion Tokens.\"\n\nHere's how you can integrate AgentOps to monitor these tokens, based on the provided information:\n\n**1. Setup & Initialization:**\n\n*   **Create an AgentOps API Key:** You need to create an API key from the AgentOps platform.  The document directs you to \"Create API Key\" (link provided in the document).\n*   **Configure Your Environment:**  Add your API key to your environment variables using the following format:\n\n    ```\n    AGENTOPS_API_KEY=<YOUR_AGENTOPS_API_KEY>\n    ```\n\n*   **Install AgentOps:** Install AgentOps using the provided code block (the specific command isn't provided in the document, but it's available in the AgentOps Repo).\n*   **Initialize AgentOps:** Before using Crew in your script, include these lines:\n\n    ```python\n    import agentops\n    agentops.init()\n    ```\n\n**2. Automatic Tracking:**\n\nThe document states that AgentOps will automatically track Crew agents. This implies that once you're set up with the API key and have initialized AgentOps, it will start collecting token usage data without requiring any additional code within your agent scripts.\n\n**3. Accessing the Data:**\n\nThe document doesn't provide specific code examples for directly accessing the token usage data within your Python script. However, it directs you to the \"AgentOps Dashboard\" (link provided in the document) where you can view these metrics.  You'll likely be able to see the number of prompt and completion tokens used by your agents through this dashboard.\n\n**Further Information:**\n\n*   For more detailed information on how to outfit more complex agentic systems and potentially access the data programmatically, consult the AgentOps documentation or join the AgentOps Discord."}
{"instruction": "**What is the purpose of the Markdown Validator example?** (To demonstrate a CrewAI agent that can be monitored with AgentOps.)", "input": "", "output": "The Markdown Validator example serves to illustrate a CrewAI agent that can be monitored using AgentOps. It's one of several examples provided to showcase the capabilities of CrewAI agents when integrated with AgentOps for observability and performance tracking. The examples, including the Job Posting and Instagram Post examples, are designed to demonstrate how AgentOps can be used to monitor different types of CrewAI agents.\n\n\n\nThere are no code examples provided for the Markdown Validator example itself within the provided document. The document only mentions it as one of the examples demonstrating CrewAI agents that can be monitored with AgentOps.\n\n\n\nTo use AgentOps with a CrewAI agent, you would follow these general steps (as outlined in the document):\n\n1.  **Create an AgentOps API Key:**  You need to create a user API key from the AgentOps platform.\n2.  **Configure Your Environment:**  Set the `AGENTOPS_API_KEY` environment variable with your API key.\n3.  **Install AgentOps:** Install the AgentOps library.\n4.  **Initialize AgentOps:**  Include `import agentops` and `agentops.init()` in your CrewAI script.\n\nWhile the document doesn's provide a specific code example for the Markdown Validator, the general setup would look something like this:\n\n```python\nimport agentops\nimport crewai\n\n# Initialize AgentOps\nagentops.init()\n\n# Your CrewAI agent definition and execution would go here\n# For example:\n# my_crew = crewai.CrewAI(...)\n# result = my_crew.run()\n```\n\nFor more detailed information on how to outfit more complex agentic systems, you can refer to the AgentOps documentation or join the AgentOps Discord."}
